# Neural Network From Scratch

## 1. Features

This "framework" is able to do :

- Multiclass classification
- Binary classification

## 2. Limitations

- The model does not support Convolutional Neural Networks

## 3. How to use

In the train package, you can find examples of how to use the framework.

### 3.1 Loading the data

Data should be loaded by the DataLoaders class. If you want to load a new dataset, you should create a method in the
DataLoaders class.
Data can be split and shuffled by the split method (specify the percentage of the training set).

```kotlin
val (train, test) = data.split(0.8)
```

### 3.2 Create the model

The model should be created by the NeuralNetwork class. You must specify the learning rate and the loss function.

```kotlin
val model = NeuralNetwork(0.001, CategoricalCrossEntropy, optimzer = SGD(0.001))
```

The optimizer is optional. By default, the model uses stochastic gradient descent. You also choose Adam.
To add layers, you should use the addLayer method and specify the number of neurons, the activation function and
initializer.

```kotlin
model.addLayer(10, ReLU, NormalHeInitialization)
```

**Warning:** The input layer is not implicit (you can just specify the number of neurons).

Finally, you should initialize the model by the initialize method.

### 3.3 Train the model

The model should be trained by the fit method. You must specify the number of epochs and data.

```kotlin
model.fit(100, data, batchSize = 32)
```

By default, the model uses stochastic gradient descent. Also, it prints the recap of each epoch. You can specify the
batch size.
When the training is done, accuracy and loss are printed in ```/resources/plots```.

### 3.4 Use the model

You can try the model with the test method. You must specify the data.

```kotlin
model.test(data)
```

### 3.5 More

Â²
You can use DebugTools to print the model's weights and deltas.

```kotlin
var debugTools = DebugTools(model)

// Every x epochs, the weights and deltas are stored
debugTools.archiveWeights()
debugTools.archiveDeltas()
debugTools.archiveBias()

// To print the weights and deltas
debugTools.printWeights()
debugTools.printDeltas()
debugTools.printBias()

// You can find plots in /resources/plots/debug
```

## 4. TODO

In the future, I would like to add more features like :

- L1 and L2 regularization
- Early stopping
